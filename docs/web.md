The web project uses next.js to leverage SSG/SSR context with apollo to leverage GQL power. The marketing app and web application are tied together currently.
Currently the web project is the only application that you need to run seperately outside the `a11ywatch` infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. `docker-compose up`

or

2. `npm run dev`
