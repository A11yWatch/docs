Core Web Vitals are a set of speed metrics that are part of Google’s Page Experience signals used to measure user experience. We retrieve them using Google’s PageSpeed Insights API externally and internally.

## Settings

1. [Get a free API key from Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started)
2. Enter the received code as the env var `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` or through the settings panel.

After you sign on go to the top-right menu and go to the settings tab.

You can then insert your code in the text input.
