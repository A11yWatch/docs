Core Web Vitals are a set of speed metrics that are part of Google’s Page Experience signals used to measure user experience. We retrieve them using Google’s PageSpeed Insights API externally and internally. It’s free but limited to a daily quota.

## Settings

1. [Get a free API key from Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started)
2. Enter the received code as the env var `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` or through the settings panel.

After you sign on go to the top-right menu and go to the settings tab.

You can then insert your code in the text input.
